            <strong><em>THE BREATHTAKING SCENERY</em></strong>

            Each of the many islands that make up the <strong>Maldives</strong> is located in the heart of the Indian Ocean and offers some remarkable views. Beautiful peaks on the interior of the islands and stunning sandy shorelines lined with palm trees are just a few of the scenic memories you can make in the Maldives. <br> Most travelers claim that the best views occur right as the sun sets each night over the ocean, ideally while you have a cold drink in your hand.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong><em>EXPERIENCE PURE LUXURY</em></strong> <br>
            <br>While there are a few budget accommodation options in the Maldives (see below for some great budget-friendly places), most of the resorts are incredibly upscale and luxurious. And that’s what most people want when they visit the Maldives: pure luxury. Resorts have spacious suites, exclusive guest patios and butler service. Expect to find fitness facilities, spas and onsite dining in every resort in the country. Staying in an overwater bungalow is a dream for many people, and there’s no better place than the Maldives to make this dream come true.

        <p>
            <strong><em>DELICIOUS DINING</em></strong> 
                
            </p>
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ac/Maldives_soft_coral.jpg/330px-Maldives_soft_coral.jpg" alt="Dining" width="300">
            <p> Guests in the Maldives have three options for dining. They can enjoy upscale international fare in the resorts, affordable local meals in the rural areas or dining in the cities of Male and Addu. Most visitors stick to the delicious food served in the resorts, but the dining in Male is much more affordable and can be a great way to try local favorites like riha curry and spicy fish cakes called kulhi borkibaa.<br>
            <br>
            If you are treating yourself to a stay in a luxurious resort, you can expect divine dining every day of your stay – and don’t worry, you won’t be eating regional dishes every day: the resorts are known for their exquisite cooking from all over the world.

            <strong><em>SCUBA DIVING</em></strong>
        </p>

        <p>
            One of the most popular pastimes in the Maldives is scuba diving. The sheer number of atolls makes it ideal for scuba diving, but also snorkeling, among the coral and the native marine life. Compared to other exotic destinations, scuba diving in the Maldives is incredibly safe as well. SUP has become an increasingly popular activity to enjoy while on holiday, and most of the resorts also offer daily yoga classes. You might also be interested in kayaking and canoeing – don’t forget to pack your waterproof camera!

            <strong><em>PRIVACY AND SECLUSION</em></strong> <br>
            <br>Although almost every visitor who arrives in the Maldives will pass through the airport in the capital city of Male, most of the resorts and accommodations are located on nearby islands. Since there are well over 1,000 islands that make up the country, resorts are often located on private islands accessible exclusively to guests and staff. If you want to see more than just one island when you visit the Maldives, you can break up your stay into two parts and stay on two different islands.
